## Quantum Information and Computing projects for course at University of Padua
## Titles: CHSH inequality violation, Quantum State Tomography

**Project Summary**: In this experiment we want to violate the CHSH inequality in order to provide a proof of Bellâ€™s theorem.

**Project Summary**: In this experiment we want to infer the density matrix of a quantum state by a series of measurement
performed on pairs of qubits.

**Abstract**: Quantum State Tomography is the process in which a quantum state is reconstructed, in an approximated
way, by performing a series of measurement on a large number of identically prepared copies of
the original state. The noise of the experimental apparatus leads to some intrinsically problems, such
as the uncertainty of the results, and the possible non-physical state as output. The latter is solved
by performing a Maximum-Likelihood estimation.
